## 🌿 A little more about me:
When I’m not writing code, you’ll probably find me in the kitchen baking something sweet or tending to my plants. I see coding a bit like baking, it’s all about layering ideas, trusting the process, and adding a touch of magic ✨

## 🌱 My Goals

- Find my first developer job in a kind, collaborative team 
- Learn React and Tailwind CSS to expand my front-end toolkit  
- Explore Figma to improve my UI/UX design workflow  
- Get more confident with WordPress for flexible content management   
- Contribute to open-source projects and grow through community
