# Hi there! 👋 I'm Aleksandra

I'm a junior front-end developer based in the UK 🇬🇧, currently taking part in a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp. I’m passionate about web development, holistic health, and building beautiful, responsive websites.

## 💻 Tech I’m working with:
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Git & GitHub
- Visual Studio Code
- JavaScript (in progress)
- Responsive Web Design

## 🔨 Projects I’m building:
- **Quiet Space** – a multi-page responsive website focused on mental health awareness and self-care. It features sections such as *Home*, *Gentle Reminders*, *Daily Care*, and *Safe Resources*, each designed to provide calm, accessible, and visually appealing content. The site is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Bootstrap 5**, with attention to accessibility (WCAG AA standards) and responsive design for all devices.

## 📚 Currently learning:
- JavaScript & Python
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Git branching and pull requests
- Writing clean, semantic code

## 🌿 A little more about me:
When I'm not coding, I'm probably watering my plants or baking cakes.  
I believe that learning to code is like baking — it takes patience, creativity, and a little bit of magic ✨

## 🌱 My goals:
- Build a clean, modern portfolio site from scratch
- Learn React and Tailwind CSS
- Contribute to open-source in the future
