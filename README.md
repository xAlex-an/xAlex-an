# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aleksandra

I'm a junior front-end developer based in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, currently taking part in a Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp. Iâ€™m passionate about web development, holistic health, and building beautiful, responsive websites.

## ðŸ”¨ Projects Iâ€™m building:
- **Quiet Space** â€“ a multi-page responsive website focused on mental health awareness and self-care. It features sections such as *Home*, *Gentle Reminders*, *Daily Care*, and *Safe Resources*, each designed to provide calm, accessible, and visually appealing content. The site is built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Bootstrap 5**, with attention to accessibility (WCAG AA standards) and responsive design for all devices.

## ðŸ“š Currently learning:
- JavaScript & Python
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Git branching and pull requests
- Writing clean, semantic code

## ðŸŒ¿ A little more about me:
When I'm not coding, I'm probably watering my plants or baking cakes.  
For me learning to code is like baking â€” it takes patience, creativity, and a little bit of magic âœ¨

## ðŸŒ± My goals:
- Build a clean, modern portfolio site from scratch
- Learn React and Tailwind CSS
- Contribute to open-source in the future
